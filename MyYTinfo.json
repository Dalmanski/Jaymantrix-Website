  "description": "✨ Hi! 80% of the videos on this channel are all about my gacha pulls. Whether I lose the 50/50 or hit hard pity, I still post it all!\n✨ Also, about 80% of my gacha games are F2P. The others are paid, but only for the monthly pass (Genshin, HSR) and one battle pass (Wuwa).\n✨ If you enjoy gacha content, please subscribe to my channel. Sankyuu~ \n\n▶️ 1st YT: Dalmanski GD\n🔗 https://www.youtube.com/@dalmanskigd\n\n▶️ My Games ID is on this website I created.\nⓘ I created my own Jaymantrix AI, start chatting with me (With limits due to Free Tier):\n🔗 https://jaymantrix-website.vercel.app/\n",
